To compile and run:
	make template
	make run


My program runs for all obvious test cases. No tested input causes a crash.

The user interface runs as per the specification in the handout.
Be advised that camera rotation, as specified in the extra features section,
is non-functional, and could not be accomplished. I would appreciate, if it can
be provided, some insight into my error.
